# 30-Days DevOps Challenge - Weather Dashboard (Day 1)

This project is a Python script that collects real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and stores it in AWS S3. It's designed with DevOps best practices in mind, including infrastructure as code, version control, and robust error handling. The system can track weather conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) for multiple cities and automatically archives the data in the cloud for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- AWS account with S3 access
- OpenWeather API key
- AWS CLI config

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone weather-dashboard-demo
    cd weather-dashboard-demo
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
    - Create a [.env](./.env) file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add your OpenWeather API key and AWS S3 bucket name to the [.env](./.env) file:
        ```env
        OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
        AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
        ```

## Follow-Up Project: Weather [JSON Viewer](https://github.com/DennisOtchere/weatherboard) (Static Web App)

As a continuation of this project, the JSON response files generated by this script were used in a follow-up project: **Weather JSON Viewer**.  

### About the Follow-Up Project
- **Purpose**: To visualize the weather data in a user-friendly way via a static web app.
- **Technology Used**: The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hosted using AWS Amplify.
- **Data Source**: The `.json` files saved by this Python script were directly integrated into the static web app for dynamic data visualization.

### Steps to Use This Project for the Viewer
1. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Execute the script to fetch and save weather data as `.json` files.
2. **Integrate with the Viewer**:
   - Transfer the generated `.json` files to the static web app's directory (e.g., `weather-data/`).
3. **Deploy the Viewer**:
   - Follow the steps in the [WeatherBoard README](https://github.com/DennisOtchere/weatherboard/blob/main/README.md) to deploy the static web app using AWS Amplify.
